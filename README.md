# Data-Analysis-Science-projects

In this repository I have a couple of recent project I have completed in college. 

The files named Final Project and Midterm, are mainly analysis based projects, with some machine learning methods such as KNN, K-means analysis and some classification. 

The movie recommender file is the output of a Statistical Machine learning project I completed, whereby I had developed 12 assoication rules from a dataset of 
roughly 24000 movie pairs.
