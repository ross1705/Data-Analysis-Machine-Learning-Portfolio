# Data/Machine Learning Projects

In this repository I have a couple of recent projects I have completed both in college, and in my own time.

The files named Final Project, Movie Moneyball and Midterm, are mainly data analysis based projects, with some machine learning methods such as KNN, K-means analysis and some classification. 

The file Bayesian Analysis is a project from a module I am doing in college at the minute, Bayesian Analysis. This project tested my ability to perform Bayesian modelling and analysis of both prior and posterior distributions. 
The Logistic Regression file is a recent Statistical  Machine Learning  project which I completed, whereby I fitted both a Logistic regression and Classification tree model to a dataset, then compared and tested their respective performances. 
The movie recommender file is the output of a Statistical Machine learning project I completed, whereby I had developed 12 association rules from a dataset of roughly 24000 movie pairs.
