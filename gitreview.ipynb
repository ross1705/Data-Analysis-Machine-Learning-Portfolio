Yeah, you're young and married No job unemployed Status thing. Yeah status is very important important or street status Well, just status in general But the way they make their status is from the streets because that's what they've got access to but I don't understand how they've not thought or if I I'm gonna stab someone, I'm going to jail. Because all stabbing ends up in killing. And if you don't kill the person, he ain't gonna tell the police, nothing. So it goes on. But when they stab, they tend to go like this area. You're fighting. And another thing is you got to understand there's stabbing as well. You can stab someone, it doesn't affect them straight away. Unless you hit them somewhere. Right in the organ. Yeah, so you can stab someone in the arm. They're drilling and pumping, they're still gonna be fighting you. So if you can't fight, so you're just stabbing, stabbing, stabbing, stabbing. Until something, they're happy. And then he drops, and then he's dead. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes people, and they don't, you're drilling and pumping, they don't even mean to get them.

If you get someone in the body, they're gonna die. Not all the time. Luke, they mostly die. How do you know? Out of all stabbing, how much percentage die?
